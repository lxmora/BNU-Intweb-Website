        <h1>About</h1>
		<p>
		This website was designed from the idea of a techno-religeon, a religeon based around the worship of technology. Specificaly, it comes from a small group that may or may not still exist that attempts to create an AI god. Reading about this group lead me to think about how you could make a temple on within a computer for worship of such a theoretical entity. This website is a step towards emulating that using the concept of the sun and the moon in various indo-european traditions.
